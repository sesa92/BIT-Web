<!--
    Inserting elements
        Start with a blank HTML page
        Using just JS (jQuery), create an image gallery
        All links to images in the gallery should be elements of the same array!
        When the gallery is created and visible on the page, create gallery title and
        insert it before the gallery images
        Go through gallery images and set a random size to each gallery image

    Bonus:
        Set a green border around each image whose width is less than 200px up
        until the first one that doesnt meet that requirement (i.e. when you get to
        the first img that is more than 200px wide, stop checking and setting green
        border).
