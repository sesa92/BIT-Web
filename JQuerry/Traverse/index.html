<!--
    Traverse (Redo Gallery)
        Create a page with two “galleries”
        Each gallery should contain 3 photos and it should be wrapped in a div
        Width of the pictures should be 33%
        One picture in the first gallery should have a red border around it
        Red border should be a result of a class named “selected”
        Create a function that selects the image with red borders and removes them, then uses traversing technique to navigate to the second gallery and applies the red borders to the middle picture
